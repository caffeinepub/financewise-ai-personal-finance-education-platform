# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the Budget Planner with richer, more realistic insights and charts, expand the finance quiz library to 100+ questions, replace the Blogs page with 15+ SEO long-form posts, and refresh the app theme and authenticated sidebar styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Upgrade Budget Planner results to include a computed line chart (e.g., projection over time), ensure a clear pie chart breakdown is shown, and add an actionable guidance section (saving, investing, next steps) that adapts to user inputs.
- Expand the quiz question dataset to 100+ unique finance questions across the requested topics and ensure the quiz UI/flow reflects the full library (not a small subset).
- Replace all existing Blogs page content with 15+ new SEO-focused long-form posts (800+ words each) covering the required personal finance topics with problem/solution framing.
- Update global background styling to remove the purple/violet/blue-heavy look and apply a consistent, more creative/advanced theme across public and authenticated pages.
- Restyle the authenticated sidebar to a dark look with green hover effects while preserving navigation structure and clear active state.
- Update internal documentation (`frontend/src/requirements/REQ-10-quiz-no-changes.md`) so it no longer prohibits quiz question additions and aligns with the 100+ questions requirement.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a more advanced Budget Planner with clearer charts and tailored improvement guidance, can take quizzes drawn from 100+ questions, read a refreshed blog library of 15+ long-form SEO posts, and experience a new consistent theme with a dark sidebar featuring green hover states.
