# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Verify AdSense integration, create a dedicated AI Insights Hub with backend connectivity, and replace the existing budget planner with an Advanced AI Budget System that includes smart allocation, savings calculation, emergency fund tracking, overspending alerts, dynamic adjustments, balance prediction, and student/professional modes—all integrated with the unified Motoko backend.

**Planned changes:**
- Verify Google AdSense script with publisher ID 'pub-5050836253831761' is present in frontend/index.html <head> and loads on all pages
- Create a dedicated AI Insights Hub page accessible from main navigation with a chat interface for natural language questions
- Connect AI Insights Hub to unified Motoko backend to read transactions, goals, budgets, preferences, and analytics in real-time
- Replace current budget planner with Advanced AI Budget System featuring mandatory fields (Monthly Income, Rent/EMI, Food, Travel, Utilities, Existing Loans) and optional fields (Entertainment, Subscriptions, Shopping, Insurance, Investments)
- Implement smart category allocation suggestion that recommends optimal expense distribution
- Add automatic savings percentage calculation based on income and expenses
- Implement emergency fund calculation with target amount and progress tracking
- Add overspending alert system that notifies users when expenses exceed budget allocations
- Implement dynamic budget adjustment that adapts recommendations based on spending patterns and income changes
- Add end-of-month balance prediction based on current spending trends
- Implement Student/Professional adaptive mode that tailors budget recommendations to user's life stage
- Store all Advanced AI Budget System data in unified Motoko backend and integrate with existing transactions, goals, and analytics modules for real-time synchronization

**User-visible outcome:** Users can verify AdSense ads are displayed across all pages, access a dedicated AI Insights Hub to ask natural language questions about their financial data, and use an Advanced AI Budget System with intelligent recommendations including smart allocations, automatic savings calculations, emergency fund tracking, overspending alerts, dynamic adjustments, balance predictions, and life-stage-specific guidance (Student/Professional modes)—all seamlessly connected to their real financial data stored in the backend.
