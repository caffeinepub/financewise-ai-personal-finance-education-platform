# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the FinanceWise AI frontend by expanding quiz content, refining key UI areas (dashboard sidebar, compare, contact), adding public-page cookie consent, and updating the site favicon.

**Planned changes:**
- Expand the quiz dataset to 100 meaningful finance-related questions with full metadata so the quiz can run through questions and validate answers properly.
- Update the authenticated/private dashboard layout so the entire sidebar navigation background is violet with readable text/icon contrast.
- Add a cookie-consent popup on public (non-authenticated) pages with an Accept button, remembering acceptance so it won’t reappear.
- Update the public contact/support email anywhere it appears to `fwiseai@gmail.com`.
- Update the Compare page by removing the “No Ads” and “Video Lessons” rows from the comparison table.
- Redesign and apply a finance-related, logo-like favicon for the site.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can take a full 100-question finance quiz, see a violet dashboard sidebar when logged in, accept a cookie notice on public pages, find the updated contact email, view a simplified Compare table, and see a new finance-themed favicon in the browser tab.
