  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via new projection logic and BudgetPlanner updates including Recharts line/pie chart imports and input-responsive recommendations. Several other requested items are either not evidenced or contradicted by the diff summary (blogs remain short problem/solution cards; sidebar remains violet gradient; no evidence of global background theme change; no evidence of updating REQ-10 quiz documentation; quiz expansion to 100+ is not verifiable from the truncated questions file and no quiz-UI/progress evidence is shown). The diff also introduces multiple unrelated features/pages not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The questions file is truncated and does not provide evidence that 100+ unique questions exist (unique IDs/prompts) or that the quiz UI initializes/reflects totalQuestions >= 100; no quiz flow/UI files are shown as changed.",

      "reason": "The blog page is described as showing exactly 15 static Problem→Solution entries in a card grid, which conflicts with the requirement for 15+ long-form (800+ words each) posts and explicitly indicates the short problem/solution format remains.",
