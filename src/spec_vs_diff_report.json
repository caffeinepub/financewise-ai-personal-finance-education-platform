  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements for the AI Budget System and AI Insights Hub. REQ-1 (AdSense verification) is fully implemented. REQ-2 and REQ-3 (AI Insights Hub page with backend integration) are implemented with frontend data integration. REQ-4 through REQ-13 (Advanced AI Budget System features) are implemented with varying degrees of completeness. However, some backend storage and real-time synchronization aspects for budget data (REQ-13) appear incomplete based on the truncated diff evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Advanced AI Budget System stores all budget data in the unified Motoko backend and integrates with existing transactions, goals, and analytics modules for real-time data synchronization",
      "reason": "While backend/main.mo includes BudgetData types and state variables (userBudgets, budgets), the diff does not show complete CRUD functions for saving/retrieving budget data from the Motoko backend. BudgetPlanner.tsx appears to calculate budgets client-side but lacks evidence of mutations to persist budget data to the backend or queries to retrieve stored budget data.",

      "requirement": "Implement dynamic budget adjustment capability that adapts budget recommendations based on actual spending patterns and income changes",
      "reason": "BudgetPlanner.tsx shows static budget calculations based on user inputs but does not demonstrate continuous monitoring of actual spending patterns over time or automatic adjustment recommendations when income changes occur. The implementation calculates budgets on-demand but lacks temporal tracking of spending patterns.",
